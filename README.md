# docker_dev_template
Based on Shopify's best practices, this code generates some folders for a new repository that will develop a docker container.

## Getting Started

Just execute the `generate.sh` script in whatever base folder you want your project to be, or inside of an existing project that doesn't have a `container` folder.

Then, customize the scripts, add files into the `container/files` folder that you want in the container, and enjoy.
